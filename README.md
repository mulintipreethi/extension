To ensure browser security and privacy, I performed a manual audit of installed browser extensions. First, I opened the browser’s extension manager by navigating to chrome://extensions/ (for Chrome) or about:addons (for Firefox). Once inside the extension manager, I carefully reviewed all installed extensions one by one. I checked each extension’s name, source, and purpose to ensure I remembered installing it and actively used it.

Next, I clicked the “Details” button on each extension to inspect the permissions they requested. I paid close attention to any that asked for excessive access, such as the ability to "Read and change all your data on all websites" or run in incognito mode. I also cross-checked the extensions with the Chrome Web Store or Firefox Add-ons site to read user reviews and developer information. Suspicious signs included poor ratings, complaints about ads or redirections, and unknown or fake-sounding developer names.

After completing the review, I identified unused and suspicious extensions—particularly those I didn’t recall installing or those with generic names and broad permissions. I then removed or disabled those extensions directly from the extension manager. After cleanup, I restarted the browser to ensure that any background processes were fully terminated. I noticed a slight improvement in browser speed and reduced lag after removing unnecessary add-ons.

Lastly, I researched how malicious browser extensions can harm users. I found that such extensions can steal sensitive data like passwords and browsing history, perform click fraud, inject ads or crypto miners, and even take control of the browser to redirect searches or track user behavior. Some malicious extensions disguise themselves as useful tools but silently collect user information and send it to third-party servers without consent.
